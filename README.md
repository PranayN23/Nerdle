# Nerdle - Interactive Math Equation Guessing Game

Nerdle is an engaging and educational math equation guessing game inspired by the popular game "Wordle." This project leverages Java's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Java Swing for GUI development, and ArrayLists for data management to create a fun and challenging gaming experience for math enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Nerdle features a visually appealing and user-friendly GUI, reminiscent of the "Wordle" interface, making it easy and enjoyable to play.

- **Math Equation Guessing:** Players must guess a math equation within a limited number of attempts, similar to guessing words in "Wordle." The goal is to find the correct equation through deduction and logic.

- **Precise Validation:** Nerdle utilizes Regex for precise validation of math equations, ensuring accuracy in gameplay, similar to word validation in "Wordle."

## Getting Started

To get started with Nerdle, clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nerdle.git
   ```

## How to Play

1. **Launch the game.**

2. The computer will randomly select a math equation that you need to guess.

3. **Enter your guess** in the input field provided on the GUI one character at a time.
